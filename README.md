# Is It Snowing In Atlanta?

## üßê

I created this tiny site right as the 2014 [Snowpocalypse was hitting Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2014_Gulf_Coast_winter_storm).  
Not much has happened to this site since, but I just moved it to a Gatsby site hosted with Netlify. One day I'll add more to it. Probably the next time it barely snows in Atlanta and I'm stuck inside for days.
